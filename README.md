# Sun Panels

A simple Minecraft mod that adds three tiers of solar panels for generating Redstone Flux (RF) energy.

## Features

This mod adds three tiers of solar panels to Minecraft:

### Basic Solar Panel

- ⚡ Power Output: 32 RF/t
- 🔋 Internal Storage: 4,000 RF
- Affordable to craft, good for early game

### Advanced Solar Panel

- ⚡ Power Output: 128 RF/t
- 🔋 Internal Storage: 16,000 RF
- Requires mid-game resources, suitable for automation

### Elite Solar Panel

- ⚡ Power Output: 512 RF/t
- 🔋 Internal Storage: 64,000 RF
- Expensive to craft, but efficient for late-game setups

## How It Works

- Sun panels generate energy during daylight hours
- Generation is affected by time of day (reduced at dawn/dusk)
- Panels must have a clear line of sight to the sky
- Energy is automatically transferred to adjacent energy-accepting blocks
- Power generation stops at night or during storms

## Multi-Mod Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with all major energy-using mods:

### RF/FE Based Mods (Native Compatibility)
Directly compatible with all Forge Energy (FE) based mods through the NeoForge energy system:

- ✅ **Thermal Series** (formerly Thermal Expansion)
- ✅ **RFTools Power**
- ✅ **Powah**
- ✅ **Ender IO**
- ✅ **Applied Energistics 2**
- ✅ **Immersive Engineering**

### Joules Based Mods
- ✅ **Mekanism**: Full integration with Mekanism's energy system
    - Energy is converted at the standard rate of 1 RF = 2.5 Joules
    - Solar panels automatically register with Mekanism via IMC

### EU Based Mods
- ✅ **Tech Reborn**: Compatible with Tech Reborn's EU system
    - Energy is converted at the standard rate of 4 RF = 1 EU
    - Fully supports Tech Reborn machines and cables

All compatibility is completely optional - the mod works fine without any of these mods installed, and will automatically detect and integrate with any that are present.
